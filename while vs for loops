 Let's explain the difference between **for** and **while** loops in a very simple way — like explaining to a baby 🍼.

---

### 👶 Imagine this:

You are playing a game.
You have two types of toys that help you **repeat** actions:

---

## 🧸 1. **FOR loop** — Like counting blocks

* You have **5 blocks**.
* You want to do something with **each block**, **one by one**.
* You already **know how many blocks** you have.

### 🗣️ You say:

> “I will play with **each block, one by one**, until all 5 are done.”

That’s a **for loop** — you know **how many times** you will do it.

### 🧠 In code:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("I played with block", i)
```

📝 This will print 5 times:

```
I played with block 0  
I played with block 1  
I played with block 2  
I played with block 3  
I played with block 4  
```

---

## 🧸 2. **WHILE loop** — Like playing until you're tired

* You don’t know **how many times** you’ll play.
* You just play until you're **tired** (some condition becomes **false**).

### 🗣️ You say:

> “I will keep playing **while I am not tired**.”

That’s a **while loop** — you **don’t know** how many times it will repeat, just **keep going** until something **stops** you.

### 🧠 In code:

```python
tired = False
count = 0

while not tired:
    print("Still playing!", count)
    count += 1
    if count == 5:
        tired = True
```

📝 This will also print 5 times and then stop.

---

## 🧠 SUPER SIMPLE COMPARISON:

| Loop Type      | You **know** how many times? | You **keep going** until something happens? |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **for loop**   | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No                                        |
| **while loop** | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                                       |

## 🐣 Everyday Baby Example:

### 🧸 For loop:

> "I will eat **3 candies**. One... Two... Three... Done!"

### 🧸 While loop:

> "I will eat candy **while I feel hungry**. When I’m full, I’ll stop."  




Yay! Let’s play with some simple examples to help you practice and **feel the difference** between `for` and `while` loops! 🎈

## 🎯 **FOR Loop Practice Examples** (You know how many times to repeat)

### 1. Print your name 5 times

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("My name is Aitbubu")
```

---

### 2. Count from 1 to 10

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

---

### 3. Print each letter in the word "PYTHON"

```python
for letter in "PYTHON":
    print(letter)
```

---

### 4. Print all even numbers from 2 to 10

```python
for i in range(2, 11, 2):
    print(i)
```

---

### 5. Print squares of numbers from 1 to 5

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i * i)
```

---

## 🎯 **WHILE Loop Practice Examples** (Repeat until something stops it)

### 6. Count from 1 to 5 using while

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

---

### 7. Keep asking the user to type "yes" until they do

```python
answer = ""
while answer != "yes":
    answer = input("Type 'yes' to stop: ")
```

---

### 8. Countdown from 5 to 1

```python
i = 5
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
```

---

### 9. Ask for password until it's correct

```python
password = ""
while password != "1234":
    password = input("Enter password: ")
print("Access granted!")
```

password = ""
tries = 0

while password != "1234" and tries < 3:
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    tries += 1

if password == "1234":
    print("Access granted!")
else:
    print("Too many attempts. You are blocked!")


---

### 10. Keep adding numbers until the total is 20 or more

```python
total = 0
while total < 20:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    total += number
print("Done! Total is", total)
```
