# Task1: Print numbers from 1 to 10.
# Use range() in a for loop.

for num in range(1, 11):
    print(num)

# Task2: Print the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
# Hint: use i ** 2.

for num in range (1, 11):
    i = num ** 2
    print(i)

#If you'd like to print both the number and its square, try:

for num in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{num} squared is {num ** 2}")

# Task3: Print all even numbers from 2 to 20.
# Use range(start, stop, step) with step 2.

for num in range(2, 21, 2):  # Change 20 to 21
    print(num)

# Task4: Calculate and print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

total = 0
for num in range(1, 101):
    total += num
print(total)

# Task5: Ask the user to input a word and print each letter of the word on a new line.
# Use for letter in word:.

word = input('Enter a word: ')
for letter in word:
    print(letter)
