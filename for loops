# Beginner level: 

# Task1: Print numbers from 1 to 10.
# Use range() in a for loop.

# Task2: Print the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
# Hint: use i ** 2.

#If you'd like to print both the number and its square, try:

# Task3: Print all even numbers from 2 to 20.
# Use range(start, stop, step) with step 2.

# Task4: Calculate and print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

# Task5: Ask the user to input a word and print each letter of the word on a new line.

#Task#5:  Print a countdown from 10 to 1.

 # Task1: Print a rectangle of stars * with 4 rows and 6 columns.

#Task2: Ask the user for a number n and print a triangle of stars with n rows.
# Example (n=4):

# Task3: Print a full multiplication table (from 1 to 10).
